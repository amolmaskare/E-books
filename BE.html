                <h2 style="font-size: 30px;"> Other Ways to Masters in Business English Online</h2>
                <p style="font-size: 20px;">The most sophisticated, talented masters of English words occasionally experience a few uneasy moments when it comes to a time when demonstrating a rich vocabulary is required.Mastering English words is the first step to mastering English communication skills.<br>
                    
                    <li><b>Determine your present level of vocabulary.</b></li>This is something you can do by taking few online Vocabulary Tests which are available through a variety of websites. Take these test to know the strengths and weaknesses in your present vocabulary. Prepare your own list of vocabulary that you can go through everyday.<br>
                    <li><b>Read a dictionary.</b></li>A dictionary is a good resource for learning and mastering English words. You don't have to read it cover to cover, just pick out a few words that interest you and learn how to use the properly. Alternatively, try an encyclopedia.<br>
                    <li><b>Buy a few books to assist in your studies. </b></li> Go to any good library or bookstore and find a knowledgeable member of staff to help you. This person may be able to listen to you speaking English and then help determine the books that will be the most useful to you.<br>
                    <li><b>Begin at your present level.</b></li>If your level of vocabulary level is high, start at the highest level where you recognize and understand every word put before you. If your vocabulary is small, work gradually to improve in constant, small steps.
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Prepare a study schedule.</b></li>Follow your schedule, even if it is only for 30 minutes per week, once a week. It's better if you can spend 10 minutes per day - daily usage and practice will help fastest.<br>
                    <li><b>Subscribe to a website which sends A Word A Day to your Inbox.</b></li>One such site is through Merriam-Webster, the dictionary company. You can find many others, as well.<br>
                    <li><b>Say each word as you read it.</b></li>This is very important. Make sure your pronunciation is correct. There's nothing more embarrassing than trying to impress people with your newfound language skills, only to find out that the word you were going for was pronounced "Fa-SEE-Shus," not "Fa-KET-EE-uss."<br>
                    (That's "facetious," by the way.) Pronouncing the words out loud will help them form naturally when you speak them in front of others. It is especially important for non-native speakers to do this as English pronunciation of letters and sounds may differ from your native language. English is notoriously tricky to master as so many of its 'rules' have exceptions.<br>
                    <li><b>Write down the definition of any new word you learn.</b></li>Write down the definition of any new word you learn.<br>
                    <li><b>Repeat the word you learn each day, adding one new word every day.</b></li>As you feel sure you will not forget word #1, drop it from the list, and continue.<br>
                    <li><b>Consider studying etymology, the history of words, and mnemonics. </b></li>Many people believe the best way to master words is to learn them through etymology and mnemonics. Learn a root so that you can learn many other words based on that root. For example the word 'literate'. Once you know that word, you can learn the modifications to that word, such as: illiterate, literature, literacy, literalism and a host of other words, to assist you in your mastery of English words.</p>
