                <h2 style="font-size: 30px;"> Best Ways to Learn Web Development Online</h2>
                <p style="font-size: 20px;">
                    If you are looking for best ways to study Wed Design with a flexible schedule and deeper learning, there are many options other than YouTube tutorials. 
                    If you don’t have any coding experience, we recommend you join a free program at Codecademy and complete the HTML/CSS course. 
                    This web development course will get you started with the basics. 
                    If you want to continue to learn new web languages, check out the other courses Codecademy offers.<br>
                    
                    <p style="font-size: 15px;"><li><b>Learn by doing.</b></li>The “learn by doing” principal is true for all of life. When it comes to web development, learning by doing is the best way to become knowledgeable in the field.
                         Instead of just signing up for a course, work on a live website or see if you can find a client who will let you build a website.<br>
                    <li><b>Don’t miss a day without writing code or learning something new.</b></li>Some people think that once they learn something, it’s time to focus on that skill. This can be good, but to succeed, learning constantly is key. 
                    In order to grow and be successful, it’s important to make a focus on writing code each day or learning something new everyday. Doing this does not only help enforce what you are learning, but also allows you to be creative. This principal is true in all of life.<br>
                    <li><b>Teach what you’re learning</b></li> Teaching someone else how to code gives you the ability to learn even more. Teaching is different than learning as you need to have a solid understanding how everything works and be able to verbalize what you have learned. 
                    This will also help you learn new skills as the learner may ask questions that you never thought about.<br>
                    <li><b>Do what you enjoy</b></li> As you learn all of the different aspects of web development, find what aspects you enjoy. Work to become the best at those aspects of web development. Learning how to develop a complete website is good to do as it allows you to see the full process, 
                    but you shouldn’t have to complete this process every time. Instead of being a creative which provides everything, work to become specialized in your skill.<br>
                    <li><b>Join the open source community</b></li> Joining an open source community not only gives you the ability to work with some accomplished developers, but also gives you exposure to some incredible coding. The open source community is also very helpful whenever you feel overwhelmed on a project. </p>
